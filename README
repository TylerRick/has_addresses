== Description



=== Running migrations



=== Bootstrapping the database



== Testing

Since the rake tasks for installing TinyMCE and updating the configuration
options are part of the unit tests, already-downloaded files are included with
the plugin.  If you want to perform a "live" test which actually downloads the
files off the Internet (rather than using the local versions), you must set
the LIVE environment variable to true.  For example,

  rake test LIVE=true

The following plugins/gems must be installed before any tests can be run:
* plugin_dependencies - http://wiki.pluginaweekk.org/Plugin_dependencies
* loaded_plugins - http://wiki.pluginaweek.org/Loaded_plugins
* appable_plugins - http://wiki.pluginaweek.org/Appable_plugins

== Dependencies

This plugin depends on the presence of the following plugins:
* has_association_helper - http://wiki.pluginaweek.org/Has_association_helper
